Any questions or feedback, please [here](https://aka.ms/aibfeedback), the Azure Image Builder Dev team is there during the week, Pacific time.

These are designed to get you started quickly, where at a minimum you just need to supply your subscriptionID (except for the RHEL example), showing you how the Azure VM Image Builder can be used to build images to meet these requirements:

* Security & Compliance - e.g. building corporate golden images, that meet your organizations security and compliance requirements.
* Licensing - e.g. building RHEL images using your eligible Red Hat Subcription licenses.
* Performance - e.g. creating images with applications pre-installed
* Management - e.g. managing images updates and global region replication
