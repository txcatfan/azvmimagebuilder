# Deprecated quickstarts

This folder contains the deprecated quickstarts transferred from Daniel Sol's Image Builder repo.

@kof-f will be updating the documentation and transferring the updated README.md files for each of the deprecated quickstarts into the official [quickstarts](https://github.com/Azure/azvmimagebuilder/tree/main/quickquickstarts) folder.
